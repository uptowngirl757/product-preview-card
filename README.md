## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used the mobile-first approach and SCSS for the first time, and I found it really awesome! I learned a lot during the process. The BEM naming convention pairs perfectly with SCSS, and I especially love how the `&` parent selector works so well in this context.

### Continued development

I really need to continue improving my SCSS skills, particularly with using mixins and other advanced features, to further enhance my development process.

### Useful resources

- [The web.dev course](https://web.dev/learn/design/picture-element?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fdesign%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fdesign%2Fpicture-elementm) - This resource was incredibly helpful in understanding responsive images, and it provided a very clear and detailed explanation
